This document contains tentative development plans/version features
It's mostly my own thoughts/priorities

Version Pre1:

Version 1.0:
 - Balance Tattoo Energy.
	- Find good default energy cap value.
	- Add energy cap to config file.
 - Render Tattoos.
	- Render tattoos on player body, only when not covered by equipment. (To better illustrate this)
	- Relate tattoo glow to player energy. (Start reducing when approaching specific thresholds)

Version 1.1:
